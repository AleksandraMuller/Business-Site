`PROJECT 3`

# Build a Business Site

This week‚Äôs project is to create a site for a company of your choice. You can come up with your own fantasy company or use an excitsting one.

**_Design_**

- Add an icon before the title in the accordion indicates whether the section is expanded or collapsed. It should update when the section expands or collapses.
- Try to add some animations on your project. For example a slide-down effect when the accordion expands and collapses.
- On hover, change the mouse cursor to something other than the default.
- Add a focus effect on the input tags (Using the CSS `:focus` pseudo-selector). Make the border or the background of the field change colour and add a glow effect.

**_Deep-dive_**

- Try out some other form elements or input types.
- Add some validation to the form.
- Add a header and/or a button on top of your video, just like Confetti, by using position: absolute and z-index to get everything in the right place.
- Make every other row in the accordion have another background color.
